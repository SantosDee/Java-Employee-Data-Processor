Java Employee Data Processor
ðŸš€ Java Employee Data Processor is a Java-based application designed to streamline data processing tasks for employee records. This project demonstrates the use of Javaâ€™s Function Interface and Stream API to perform efficient data manipulation and transformation on a large dataset. The application reads employee data, processes it, and generates insightful outputs such as average salary and filtered employee lists, providing a practical approach to handling data collections in Java.



Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to utilize Javaâ€™s Function interface and Stream API, showing the advantages of functional programming in data manipulation. Key objectives include:


Concatenating employee details.
Calculating average salaries.
Filtering based on specified criteria (age threshold).
By encapsulating data operations within these Java interfaces, we achieve an efficient, readable, and modular approach to data processing.


Key Features
Data Transformation: Uses the Function interface to create a function that concatenates employee name and department.
Data Aggregation: Calculates the average salary using Stream API's built-in functions.
Data Filtering: Applies an age filter to include only employees above a specified threshold.
Stream Chaining: Demonstrates the power of method chaining for concise data operations.
How It Works
Data Collection Initialization:
Initializes a list of employee objects, each containing a name, age, department, and salary.
Concatenate Employee Details:
Uses the Function interface to generate concatenated strings of employee names and departments.
Average Salary Calculation:
Implements the Stream API to calculate the average salary of employees in the dataset.
Age-Based Filtering:
Filters employees based on a given age threshold using Stream API.
